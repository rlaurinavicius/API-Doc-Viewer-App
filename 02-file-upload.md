# 2. File Upload & Project Navigation

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to:
*   View a list of existing projects in a left-hand navigation menu (similar to Postman collections).
*   Select a project from the navigation menu.
*   Upload multiple API documentation files (.yaml or .json) under the selected project.
*   See the API endpoints from the uploaded documents displayed under the project in the navigation bar.
